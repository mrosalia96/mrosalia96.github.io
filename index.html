                Hi, I'm Michael Rosalia! I'm a six-year US Navy Veteran (E-5) currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration at the University of San Diego. My unique combination of military experience, technical skills, and business knowledge gives me a well-rounded perspective on solving complex problems.
              </p>
                <p>
                  My journey spans from leading RF troubleshooting operations as an Electronics Technician in the Navy to exploring the world of data engineering. At Forward Slope, Inc., I worked as an Installation Engineer where I traveled internationally to countries like Azerbaijan to install complex sensor and communication systems. This role allowed me to collaborate directly with host countries' military personnel, conduct site surveys for optimal system architecture, and create detailed technical documentation for critical systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm particularly passionate about the data science field, where I can combine analytical thinking with programming to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. My recent work as a Data Engineer Intern at a Financial Engineering Firm allowed me to design custom financial data solutions that reduced manual processing time by 70% while ensuring complete accuracy in financial reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My Computer Science coursework in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Data Science Foundations has strengthened my technical skills, while my Business Administration minor provides me with valuable context on how technology solutions impact organizational objectives and business processes. This interdisciplinary approach helps me bridge the gap between technical implementation and business value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond academics and professional work, I maintain an active wellness-based lifestyle through a variety of physical activities. I'm an avid cyclist, regularly practicing Jiu Jitsu, and incorporating yoga into my routine for balance and flexibility. When I have free time, I also enjoy golfing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I enjoy developing personal projects that combine my interests in technology and well-being, such as my meditation application that facilitates Wim Hof breathing exercises. I actively participate in the tech community through my memberships with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

              <h3>Birthday Paradox Simulator</h3>
              <p>
                The Birthday Paradox demonstrates a counterintuitive probability: in a room of just 23 people, there's a 50% chance that at least two share a birthday. This mathematical phenomenon contradicts many people's initial thoughts that the probability should be much lower, given 365 possible birthdays in a year.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this project, my teammate Diego Hook and I implemented a comprehensive object-oriented simulation framework in Java. This design consists of several key components: a <code>Birthday</code> class that encapsulates month and day with proper <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> implementations for collision detection; a <code>Month</code> enum representing calendar months with varying days; a <code>Trial</code> class that generates and evaluates random birthday sets; and an <code>Experiment</code> class that runs multiple trials to calculate probability statistics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The implementation uses several advanced Java features and design patterns. I employed polymorphism and dependency injection to ensure components were readily testable. The <code>Random</code> class is passed throughout the system rather than instantiated locally, allowing testing with fixed seeds. I also used JUnit for verification and Mockito for isolating components during testing, implementing edge case handling for empty groups, single individuals, and maximum population sizes (367 people, which guarantees collisions).
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of object-oriented design principles and probability theory. I gained practical experience with Java's collection framework and I learned techniques for simulating probabilistic events and calculating reliable results over multiple trials. The project also improved my ability to write robust unit tests that cover edge cases, use mocking frameworks to isolate system components.

              <h3>Elevator Simulator Project</h3>
              <p>
                For this project, my teammate Chris Najera and I designed and implemented a comprehensive elevator simulator that models how different types of elevators service a multi-story building. The system manages multiple elevator types (Standard, Freight, Penthouse, and Express), each with unique movement rules and constraints. This project demonstates their operations and ability to efficiently handle passenger requests.
              </p>
              <p>
                The functional requirements of our simulator included handling elevator calls with specified start and end floors, coordinating multiple elevators with different service capabilities, implementing scheduling algorithms to assign calls to appropriate elevators, and visualizing the state of the entire system throughout the simulation. Each elevator moves one floor per time unit, must stop to pick up and drop off passengers, and returns to the ground floor when idle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our design approach focused on applying object-oriented principles and SOLID design patterns. We created an interface-based approach where an <code>IElevator</code> interface defined common behaviors, while an <code>AbstractElevator</code> class provided shared implementation. We then implemented four concrete elevator classes with specialized behaviors. This approach demonstrates the Open-Closed Principle by allowing new elevator types to be added without modifying existing code, and the Single Responsibility Principle by giving each class a clear, focused purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was personally responsible for designing and implementing the core elevator architecture, starting with the <code>IElevator</code> interface that defined the common behaviors all elevator types would share. I then developed the <code>AbstractElevator</code> class that provided reusable implementation for common functionality while leaving specialized behavior to be implemented by concrete classes. The most challenging aspect was implementing the four concrete elevator types (Standard, Freight, Penthouse, and Express), each with unique movement rules and call acceptance logic. I had to carefully design the <code>canServiceCall()</code> method for each type to correctly apply their specific constraints while maintaining a consistent interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout this project, I followed a test-driven development process, writing unit tests before implementing each elevator component. This approach helped me identify edge cases early, such as how elevators should manage direction changes and handle floor restrictions. This project significantly improved my understanding of object-oriented principles like polymorphism, and encapsulation.

              <h3>Meditation and Breathing App</h3>
              <p>
                This project focused on developing a specialized Python application that facilitates Wim Hof breathing exercises, a technique known for its potential wellness benefits. Using the <code>Tkinter</code> library, I created a simple interface that guides users through structured breathing cycles while providing visual and text-based cues for each phase of the exercise.
              </p>
              <p>
                The functional requirements included implementing precise timing mechanisms for breathing phases (inhale, exhale, and breath retention), creating a round-based system to manage multiple cycles of the Wim Hof method, developing contextual motivational messaging that appears at strategic points during the exercise (halfway, near completion, and final breath), and designing a clean, distraction-free user interface with a calming color scheme.
              </p>
              <p>
                My design approach centered on creating an application that prioritizes simplicity and user focus during meditation. I implemented a minimalist interface with a soothing light blue background and contrasting text that's easy to read. The architecture separates the UI components from the timing logic through the use of threading, preventing interface freezing during the timed breathing sessions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The implementation uses <code>Tkinter</code> for all GUI elements and employs Python's <code>threading</code> module to handle timing operations without blocking the main interface thread. I used a state machine approach for managing the different breathing phases, with each breath cycle consisting of 30 alternating inhale/exhale cycles followed by a 60-second breath retention period. The app tracks progress and provides encouraging messages at key points (breath 15: "Halfway there", breath 24: "Almost there", breath 29: "Last one") to maintain user engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this project, I gained valuable experience in designing wellness applications with precise timing requirements, multithreaded programming to maintain responsive interfaces, and creating intuitive user experiences for guided practices. The implementation of threaded timing operations was particularly educational, as it required careful coordination between the UI updates and the meditation timing logic.

              <h3>Financial Institution Processor</h3>
              <p>
                Engineered a financial data processing system in Python, implementing an ETL pipeline that automates consolidation of transaction data, featuring custom validation rules, dynamic CSV parsing, and standardized output generation, resulting in improved data accuracy and processing efficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The functional requirements included developing a system that could process transaction data from multiple financial institutions with varying formats (Apple Card, American Express, Navy Federal, Bank of America, Chase, and Wells Fargo). The system needed to normalize date formats, standardize amount representations, extract transaction descriptions, handle different header structures, and create a unified output format while preserving data integrity across sources.
              </p>
              <p>
                My design approach utilized a rule-based architecture using dictionary configurations to define the unique characteristics of each financial institution's data format. I implemented a configurable header detection system capable of identifying file sources based on their structure, alongside flexible data extraction logic that adapts to each institution's specific formatting. This approach made the system extensible, allowing new financial institutions to be added by simply defining their rule sets.
              </p>
              <p>
                The implementation handles challenges including multiple date formats, varying header positions, different amount representations, and institution-specific nuances. Key technical features include intelligent file type detection, Unicode handling with fallback encoding options, chronological transaction ordering, and automatic archiving with timestamped backups.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project significantly improved my company's financial data processing capabilities, reducing manual data consolidation time by approximately 70%. Through this work, I strengthened my skills in Python data processing, file manipulation, and designing complex rule-based systems. The experience of building a solution that handles real-world inconsistencies in financial data formats taught me valuable lessons about creating robust, maintainable software for business applications.

              <h3>Flashcard System</h3>
              <p>
                The Flashcard System is a comprehensive learning application designed to help users create, organize, and study flashcards effectively. This project addresses the inefficiencies of traditional study methods by providing a digital solution with multiple card types, flexible study strategies, and progress tracking capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developed collaboratively with Diego Hook, this system supports various card types including basic question-answer cards and true/false cards. The application features different study strategies like sequential and random card presentation, allowing users to customize their learning experience. The system also tracks study statistics and provides progress insights to help users optimize their learning sessions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our design heavily emphasizes object-oriented programming principles and design patterns. We implemented the Factory Pattern through <code>CardFactory</code> for centralized card creation, the Strategy Pattern for interchangeable study algorithms, and the Singleton Pattern for consistent file management. The architecture includes an <code>ICard</code> interface with concrete implementations (<code>BasicCard</code>, <code>TrueFalseCard</code>) extending an <code>AbstractCard</code> class, demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism effectively.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was mainly responsible for the card design, including the <code>ICard</code> interface, <code>AbstractCard</code> base class, and the concrete implementations of <code>BasicCard</code> and <code>TrueFalseCard</code>. I also developed the <code>Deck</code> class for managing collections of flashcards and implemented the main <code>FlashcardApp</code> class that coordinates all system components. We followed test-driven development throughout the project, achieving 80-85% code coverage across all components.
              </p>
              </p>
              <p>
                This project enhanced my understanding of software design patterns, collaborative development using Git with proper branching and pull request workflows, and the importance of clean code principles. The experience of building a complete learning application from design to implementation provided valuable insights into creating real-world software solutions while maintaining high quality standards.
